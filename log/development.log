Flexible in terms of working autonomously or with close mentorship. If there's something I don't know or am not sure of, I will always ask questions to make sure I'm producing the best product possible, but am also adept at figuring things out on my own.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like it could be a good fit, I'd love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJessie Richardson"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"18"}

You are a voice of reason and balance in this chaotic new world of media sensationalism. I truly enjoy your podcasts and articles.\r\n\r\nMy name is Jessie Richardson and I'm a junior full-stack developer who has been programming professionally for a little over a year and a half, and prior to that, attended a code bootcamp for Ruby on Rails.\r\n\r\nI currently work for a very small, 3 person game startup, that is, unfortunately going under in a week or so, and am looking for a new position as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI am accustomed to working largely with React and Clojure on the front-end, and Rails on the back-end, though at my current job, we used an SDK to manage our back-end, with CouchDB as a database. \r\n\r\nPersonality-wise, I am ambitious, easy-going, and a quick-learner. Flexible in terms of working autonomously or with close mentorship. If there's something I don't know or am not sure of, I will always ask questions to make sure I'm producing the best product possible, but am also adept at figuring things out on my own.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like it could be a good fit, I'd love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJessie Richardson"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"18"}

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CoverLettersController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

We're a fast-growing company that balances the culture of a startup with the stability of being an established, profitable business. We want to work with people that strive to be in the top .01% of their field. We understand that getting to the top takes hard work, constant improvement, and by making data-driven decisions. It's an exciting time to join the team, as we're expanding our product offerings in creative new ways, driving innovation through data, marketing, and web & app development.\r\n\r\nWe believe in diversity and hiring people from all backgrounds and walks of life (it makes our company parties more exciting!). You must be energetic, inventive, a team player and looking to help build and grow the company each and every day. You must have an inner desire to win and the idea of losing is a non-starter. Please note, if you need direct supervision or constant instructions on what to do next, this position probably isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for a position that allows you to work with a group of smart and dedicated people who will support you but still provide the autonomy you need to execute your strategy, then you should probably apply as soon as you're done reading this!\r\n\r\nWhat's the Day to Day like? \r\nIn our team of developers, every developer has some ownership of a portion of our architecture. There are several different applications, all with a roadmap of features and fixes that you can sink your teeth into. These range from our main Rails application (Rails, Unicorn, Nginx) to data collection and archiving (Redis, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Mongo, etc.). Most of our development is done in Ruby but we do have portions written in other languages as well (PHP, Go, Elixir, etc). \r\n\r\n\r\nA software engineer joining our team would be expected to not only handle the normal bug mashing and feature implementation but also work on making our software and processes more developer friendly. We expect members of our team to be vocal about problems that they see as we prefer to be proactive rather than reactive. If you're going through a code base and see inefficiencies that need to be attended to, we'll get them on the short-term road map or, in some cases, just work it into an existing task depending on what makes the most sense. Our engineering team is a strong proponent of the phrase \"leave it better than you found it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are we looking for? \r\n\r\nWe're looking for someone with a BS or MS in Computer Science, Math, Engineering or even a Ruby-centric developer bootcamp. You should also have 1+ years of professional full-stack Ruby experience and have a good grasp of the language and the interpreter. You should have familiarity with Ruby frameworks other than Rails (Sinatra, Padrino, EventMachine, etc.). You should be comfortable working with various databases and picking up new technologies.  We build on and deploy to Unix-based operating systems and we also rely on Docker/Kubernetes for many of our applications. You should always want to be learning and taking the initiative to teach yourself cutting edge tech.

We're a fast-growing company that balances the culture of a startup with the stability of being an established, profitable business. We want to work with people that strive to be in the top .01% of their field. We understand that getting to the top takes hard work, constant improvement, and by making data-driven decisions. It's an exciting time to join the team, as we're expanding our product offerings in creative new ways, driving innovation through data, marketing, and web & app development.\r\n\r\nWe believe in diversity and hiring people from all backgrounds and walks of life (it makes our company parties more exciting!). You must be energetic, inventive, a team player and looking to help build and grow the company each and every day. You must have an inner desire to win and the idea of losing is a non-starter. Please note, if you need direct supervision or constant instructions on what to do next, this position probably isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for a position that allows you to work with a group of smart and dedicated people who will support you but still provide the autonomy you need to execute your strategy, then you should probably apply as soon as you're done reading this!\r\n\r\nWhat's the Day to Day like? \r\nIn our team of developers, every developer has some ownership of a portion of our architecture. There are several different applications, all with a roadmap of features and fixes that you can sink your teeth into. These range from our main Rails application (Rails, Unicorn, Nginx) to data collection and archiving (Redis, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Mongo, etc.). Most of our development is done in Ruby but we do have portions written in other languages as well (PHP, Go, Elixir, etc). \r\n\r\n\r\nA software engineer joining our team would be expected to not only handle the normal bug mashing and feature implementation but also work on making our software and processes more developer friendly. We expect members of our team to be vocal about problems that they see as we prefer to be proactive rather than reactive. If you're going through a code base and see inefficiencies that need to be attended to, we'll get them on the short-term road map or, in some cases, just work it into an existing task depending on what makes the most sense. Our engineering team is a strong proponent of the phrase \"leave it better than you found it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are we looking for? \r\n\r\nWe're looking for someone with a BS or MS in Computer Science, Math, Engineering or even a Ruby-centric developer bootcamp. You should also have 1+ years of professional full-stack Ruby experience and have a good grasp of the language and the interpreter. You should have familiarity with Ruby frameworks other than Rails (Sinatra, Padrino, EventMachine, etc.). You should be comfortable working with various databases and picking up new technologies.  We build on and deploy to Unix-based operating systems and we also rely on Docker/Kubernetes for many of our applications. You should always want to be learning and taking the initiative to teach yourself cutting edge tech. Performance optimizations, experimenting with new features, splitting big applications into smaller apps, and rapidly iterating on a piece of code should excite you.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, we're looking for someone who is good natured and loves taking on new challenges but still is not afraid to ask for help when they are in the weeds.
